### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/zapatran/hugo-oblate-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/zapatran/hugo-oblate-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/zapatran/hugo-oblate-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) file to the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change the strings as you like to customize your website.

Make sure to update the `themesDir` property in the config file to point to your site's theme folder, otherwise an error will be thrown indicating the themes folder is unable to be found.
