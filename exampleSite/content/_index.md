# Hi, I'm Thor

Iâ€™m a __developer__, __designer__, and __former chef__ from Chicago. I build open source projects and write the missing instruction manuals of the web.

I created this site to document everything I learn, and share a bit of [myself](/) with the world. My site has no ads, affiliates, sponsored posts, or paywalls. If you enjoy my content, please consider supporting what I do.
